C++ Program to Check Whether a Number can be Express as Sum of Two Prime Numbers
Example to check if an integer (entered by the user) can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers of all possible combinations with the use of functions.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following C++ programming topics:

C++ for Loop
C++ if, if...else and Nested if...else
C++ Functions
C++ User-defined Function Types
This program takes a positive integer from the user and checks whether that number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

If the number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers, the output shows the combination of the prime numbers.

To perform this task, a user-defined function is created to check prime number.

Example: Check Whether a Number can be Expressed as a Sum of Two Prime Numbers
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool check_prime(int n);

int main() {

  int n, i;
  bool flag = false;

  cout << "Enter a positive  integer: ";
  cin >> n;

  for(i = 2; i <= n/2; ++i) {
    if (check_prime(i)) {
      if (check_prime(n - i)) {
        cout << n << " = " << i << " + " << n-i << endl;
        flag = true;
      }
    }
  }

  if (!flag)
    cout << n << " can't be expressed as sum of two prime numbers.";

  return 0;
}

// check prime number
bool check_prime(int n) {
  int i;
  bool is_prime = true;

  // 0 and 1 are not prime numbers
  if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
    is_prime = false;
  }
  
  for(i = 2; i <= n/2; ++i) {
    if(n % i == 0) {
      is_prime = false;
      break;
    }
  }

  return is_prime;
}
